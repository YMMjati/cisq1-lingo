Feature: Play Lingo
  As a Player,
  I want to guess a word with 5-7 letters, using the first letter, within 5 turns,
  So I can win points and advance to the next round by guessing the word right, or lose the game if I don't.

Feature: Play concurrent Lingo sessions
  As a Player,
  I want to play one or more concurrent Lingo sessions,
  In order to practice for a real-life match, with or without other trainees who can also use the session(s).

Feature: Retrieving a Lingo session's status
  As a Player,
  I want to be able to retrieve the status of an individual Lingo session,
  So I can play the session without time constraints, and in multiple sittings.
